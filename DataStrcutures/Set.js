    A Redis set is an unordered collection of unique strings (members). You can use Redis sets to efficiently:

Track unique items (e.g., track all unique IP addresses accessing a given blog post).
Represent relations (e.g., the set of all users with a given role).
Perform common set operations such as intersection, unions, and differences.
